# Course Project
_Single-page Applications with Angular 2_

## Project Description

Design and implement a **Single-page application** using [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)

It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any other web application by your choice.


### Public Part

The **public part** of your projects should be **visible without authentication**.
This public part could be the application start page, application statistics, the user login and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.

### Private Part (Registered users area)

**Registered users** should have personal area in the web application accessible after **successful login**.
This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.

### Deliverables

- Record a short video showcasing your application
  - ~1-2 minutes, just show the interesting features
  - Do not record register/login functionality, this is not interesting...
- Upload your application in the cloud
  - MS Azure, HerokuCloud, Amazon, all are fine
- Register your application at [Our Showcase System](http://best.telerikacademy.com)
  - Link to the live application
  - Link to the video
  - Link to the github repository
